	* linklint: now tracks links to stylesheets and javascript files.

	* linklint: anchors are designated as <h1 id="anchor"> in addition
	to the old-fashioned <a name="anchor">. Also included id's on h2
	through h6, div, and p tags. Yes, I know that id's on other tags
	are valid too, but this is a start.
