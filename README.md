# Linklint

## Fork

This is a fork of the linklint package written by James Bowlin. And
Linklint itself was a total rewrite of Rick Jansen's 1996-04-15
version of webxref.

The last publically available version of the original linklint was
2.4beta, released in 2001. See http://www.linklint.org/ for more
information.

In my humble opinion, linklint is still a useful utility, but was
showing its age as far as HTML standards. Here are some updates so it
can parse more modern HTML.

See the Changelog.md file for changes since the forked version.

## License

This fork of Linklint continues to be distributed under the GPL
version 2, or any later version at your choice. See the included
LICENSE file for more details.

## Installation
